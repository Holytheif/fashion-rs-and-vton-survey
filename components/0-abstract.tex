	In the rapidly evolving landscape of fashion e-commerce, the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has ushered in a transformative era. This survey paper delves into AI-based Clothing Recommendation and Virtual Try-On Systems. We explore diverse approaches, from fashion item compatibility to complete outfit generation, highlighting their pivotal role in tailoring clothing suggestions to individual preferences. Simultaneously, Virtual Try-On Systems emerge as a revolutionary solution to address the biggest challenge of online clothing shopping - "Will it fit and look good on me?" Our analysis spans various dimensions of virtual try-on, including everything from 2D image-based systems to cutting-edge AR solutions. By virtually placing customers in garments, these systems offer an immersive, confidence-boosting experience, ultimately reducing return rates and enhancing overall customer trust.
	
	This literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of clothing recommendation and virtual try-on systems, with a particular focus on their integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, computer vision, and augmented reality (AR).	As we explore the technologies and practical implementations, we shed light on the remarkable progress made in the fashion industry, empowering customers to make informed and satisfying clothing choices the comfort of their homes.
