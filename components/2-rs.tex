\section{Recommendation systems} \label{section:rs}
	Recommendation systems leverage data and algorithms to offer personalized suggestions to users, enhancing their decision-making in various domains. These systems use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, facilitating tailored content, product, or service recommendations, ultimately improving user engagement and satisfaction in diverse applications, from e-commerce to content streaming.

	Clothing and fashion recommendation systems present a unique and intricate challenge compared to general recommendation systems. They must consider not only user preferences but also the highly subjective and context-dependent nature of fashion. Recommending apparel necessitates understanding intricate details like style, fit, and individual tastes, which can evolve over time. The ever-changing fashion trends further complicate the task. Fashion items often involve combinations, making recommendations more complex.

	Moreover, the emotional aspect of fashion and the need for users to express their individuality make it challenging to predict preferences accurately. These systems must encompass visual recognition, trend analysis, and personalization, making fashion recommendation systems not only distinct but also more demanding to develop with precision.

	\subsection{Goals of recommendation systems}
		Studying the literature for clothing and fashion recommendation systems reveals the following goals:

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Outfit recommendation: This is similar to the goal of generic recommendation systems as it aims to recommend garments or outfits based on the user's preferences (e.g., complex color patterns, or specific fabrics and textures), body attributes like color and shape, current trends, and custom contexts specified by the user (e.g., outfit for a formal party) \cite{DBLP:conf/sigir/LiW0CXC20, 9156794, 8932738, DBLP:conf/mm/HidayatiHCHFC18, DBLP:journals/tmm/ZhangJGZZLT17, DBLP:conf/waim/ShaWZFZY16}.
			\item Outfit generation: This goal is, given a clothing item (e.g., a shirt), find the best garment (e.g., a tie) or outfit (e.g., from pants, skirts, ties, shoes, or hats) that is compatible with the given item. A special case of this goal is pair generation, where one item is the query and a suitable pairing item is needed. This is usually done for top and bottom items \cite{9156535, 9893574, DBLP:conf/kdd/ChenHXGGSLPZZ19}.
			\item Outfit completion: This is when most of the outfit is in place, and the task is to complete the outfit's missing items (e.g., what shoes to wear with this outfit?). Also known as fill-in-the-blank (FITB) test \cite{9857004, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2005-06584, DBLP:conf/mm/SongHLCXN19}.
			\item Outfit compatibility evaluation: Also an implicit goal for other tasks, this aims to score an outfit based on how compatible its constituent elements are. This can be used as a metric to rank outfits (e.g., does the red shirt go well with the black skirt and black socks or is the white shirt better?) \cite{DBLP:journals/eswa/MoZPW23, 10049142, DBLP:journals/eswa/BalimO23,9775146, DBLP:conf/iccvw/KimSMSSP21, DBLP:journals/ijon/SunHWZP20, DBLP:conf/sigir/DongWSDN20, DBLP:conf/www/YinL0019, DBLP:conf/aaai/YangMLWC19}.
			\item Explainable recommendation: An explanation describes why something was recommended to the user. Explanations are more transparent than black-box recommendations and improve the user experience in a variety of ways. They enhance user trust and understanding, lead to error detection and correction, mitigate bias and promote fairness, and increase user engagement. In recent years, more work has been done on explainable fashion recommendation \cite{DBLP:journals/tomccap/YangSFWDN21, DBLP:journals/www/LiCH21, 9522737, DBLP:journals/tkde/LinRCRMR20, DBLP:conf/wacv/TangsengO20, DBLP:conf/ijcai/HouWCLZL19, DBLP:conf/sigir/ChenCXZ0QZ19}.
