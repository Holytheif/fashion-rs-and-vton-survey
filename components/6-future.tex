\section{\textbf{Future Outlook and Research Directions}} \label{section:future}
	In the future, we expect the following areas of research to receive more attention and be the subject of future studies:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Inclusion of body attributes into personalized recommendation systems.
		\item Explainable recommendation and fusion with large-language models for chatbots and digital assistant applications.
		\item Recognizing and forecasting fashion trends to recommend clothing.
		\item Deployment of models and systems so online performance under real-world loads and constraints can be evaluated.
		\item Robust and visually appealing AR implementations of virtual try-on.
